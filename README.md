# CPSC422
This is an advanced AI course that builds on the foundations of CPSC 322 and CSPC 312 to show how to build intelligent agents that can observe the world, create appropriate representations, perform inference on those and act appropriately. Such agents include robots, intelligent tutoring systems, diagnostic agents, purchasing agents, and game agents. (ref:cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/TEACHING/CPSC422-15-2/index.html)
