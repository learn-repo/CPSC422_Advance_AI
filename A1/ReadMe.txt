This program is build and compiled in eclipse. Compiled with java version 1.8.
I have already exported a jar version for you convinence. (To start the jar, cd to the directroy and do 'java -jar cpsc422a1q3.jar'

There are some command that will be useful:

run 1: Run sequnce #1 given in the assignment
run 2: Run sequnce #2
run 3: Run sequnce #3
run 4: Run sequnce #4
run all: Run all sequnces from 1 to 4.
reset: reset to default states
exit: exit the program

If you terminal has a limited height, I suggest running them individually.
If you are unable to get it to work, I have attached the sample output in the output.txt file
